[The Sanskrit Handbook: A Guide for Yoga Students](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJPH4ZZW/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2MM4ZAY0VSEN&keywords=the+sanskrit+handbook&qid=1696206605&sprefix=the+sanskrit+handbook+cadieux%2Caps%2C672&sr=8-1), is a Sanskrit language and grammar textbook. I wrote it to make Sanskrit accessible to beginners. It is geared toward students of yoga, but anyone with an interest in language could find it useful.
