I am pursuing my PhD in social psychology at the University of California, Riverside under the supervision of [Dr. Sonja Lyubomirsky](https://sonjalyubomirsky.com/). I am interested broadly in well-being and specifically in spirituality, psychedelics, and social connection.

Before beginning my PhD, I was a research assistant studying mindfulness and fake news with [Dr. Ellen Langer](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/ellen-langer) at Harvard University. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in sociology from The Ohio State University.
