I am pursuing my PhD in social psychology at the University of California, Riverside under the supervision of Dr. Sonja Lyubomirsky. My research interests include well-being, religion and spirituality, culture, and the effects of psychedelics on social connection and wellness. 

Before beginning my PhD, I was a research assistant studying mindfulness and fake news with Dr. Ellen Langer at Harvard University. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in sociology from The Ohio State University.
